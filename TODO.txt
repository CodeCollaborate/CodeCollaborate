things to put on redis:
	temerary storage of project permissions w/ decaying timer
	web auth tokens? (I think this is a no)
	permission constants
	online clients
	subscriptions?

intergoprocdandling todos:
	check if permission high enough on project before taking some actions
	user authentication / registration
	figure out how to close ws connection on malicious request
	un-hardcode '10' as the owner constant in the stored proc
	figure out how to subscribe the sending go routine to more/less rabbit sockets
	fix project_delete sproc to verify if has user with username = senderID has permission
